<a name="PREFATORY"></a><h2><a name="Page_6"></a>PREFATORY.</h2>

<p>In the <i>History and Genealogies of Ancient
Windsor, Conn.</i>, published in 1859, speaking
of the influence of the old French wars upon
the religious, moral and social life of New
England, I used this language:</p>

<p>&quot;Then came war, and young New England
brought from the long Canadian campaigns,
stores of loose camp vices and recklessness,
which soon flooded the land with immorality
and infidelity. The church was neglected,
drunkenness fearfully increased, and social
life was sadly corrupted. <i>Bundling</i>&mdash;that
ridiculous and pernicious custom which pre<a name="Page_7"></a>vailed
among the young to a degree which
we can scarcely credit&mdash;sapped the fountain
of morality and tarnished the escutcheons of
thousands of families.&quot;</p>

<p>Hereupon there came a buzzing around
my ears. Divers good sons of Connecticut
winced under the soft impeachment of having
a bundling ancestry, and intimated that
my sketch of society in the olden times was
somewhat overdrawn. In 1861, an esteemed
antiquarian friend in Connecticut wrote me
as follows: &quot;Some of your friends feel that,
in your <i>History of Windsor</i>, you showed too
much inclination to malign, or at least
ridicule, Connecticut institutions, though I
think none of them accuse you of malice
in the matter, and they fear that this subject
of bundling cannot be ventilated with<a name="Page_8"></a>out
endangering the fair fame of old Connecticut.&quot;</p>

<p>Upon that hint I speak. Although born
in the city of New York, I am the son of
Connecticut parents, and proud to trace my
descent through six generations of honest,
hard-working, God-fearing Connecticut yeomanry.
By the mere accident of birth I
cannot feel myself absolved from that allegiance
to the Wooden Nutmeg State, which is
imposed upon me by the ties of ancestry, of
relationship, of youthful associations, and
last, not least, by the deep interest which I
have taken in the history of one of its eldest-born
towns. I am, indeed, at this day, to
all intents and purposes, as wholly and truly
a Connecticut man as if born within her borders;
and as proud of her past, as hopeful of
<a name="Page_9"></a>her future, and as jealous of her reputation
as any one could desire. I trust, therefore,
that I may be allowed to disclaim any &quot;inclination
to malign, or at least ridicule Connecticut
institutions,&quot; a task which, in my
case, would savor of ingratitude, and which
I should consider unworthy of my humble
pen.</p>

<p>I cannot but think, also, that those who
have found, or think that they have found,
an inimical design in any pleasantries in
which I may have indulged while describing
the customs and manners of by-gone days&mdash;have
betrayed a <i>thin-skinnedness</i>, and an
ignorance of the true glory of Connecticut
history, when they imagine that her fair
fame can be seriously tarnished by the fly-specks
of certain customs&mdash;at no time without
<a name="Page_10"></a>their vigorous opponents&mdash;and long since
rendered obsolete by the march of improvement.</p>

<p>The fun of the thing, however, is, that the
sentence which has thus called forth the animadversions
of the critics, will be found, with
its context, on closer examination, to have
applied to the <i>New England Colonies</i>, and
not to Connecticut alone! In their haste to
vindicate the land of steady habits, they seem
to have assumed more than their share of
the reproach involved in my simple historical
statement.</p>

<p>As for myself, I am no believer in the
theory that the objectionable portions of history
should be kept in the background, and
that only the bright side should be turned
towards the world.  If, as one has happily
<a name="Page_11"></a>said, &quot;history is experience teaching by example,&quot;
we most surely need to have both
sides fairly presented to us before we can
properly extract therefrom the lesson of good
or of evil which is therein taught. It is unnecessary
to pursue the argument further.
Suffice it to say, that perfection is as little
to be expected in the history of a state or a
community, as in the life of an individual.
As to our ancestors, we must take them as
history shows them to us&mdash;&quot;men of like
passions with ourselves,&quot; and &quot;in all respects
tempted as we are,&quot; yet neither worse, nor,
again, very much purer or better than ourselves.</p>

<p>In this spirit I have undertaken to trace,
in the following pages, the origin, progress
and decline of the custom of bundling in
<a name="Page_12"></a>America, together with such facts as clearly
prove that it was not confined to this continent,
but prevalent in various countries of
the world.</p>

<a name="Page_13"></a>
<div class="blkquot"><p>BUNDLING. &quot;A man and a woman lying on the same bed
with their clothes on; an expedient practiced in
America on a scarcity of beds, where, on such occasions,
husbands and parents frequently permitted travellers
to <i>bundle</i> with their wives and daughters.&quot;&mdash;<i>Grose,
Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</i>.</p>

<p>BUNDLE, <i>v.i.</i> &quot;To sleep on the same bed without undressing;
applied to the custom of a man and woman,
especially lovers, thus sleeping.&quot;&mdash;<i>Webster, 1864</i>.</p>

<p>BUNDLE, <i>v.n.</i> &quot;To sleep together with the clothes on.&quot;&mdash;<i>Worcester, 1864</i>.</p></div>

<p>Bundling, as may be seen from the above
quoted definitions, was practiced in two forms:
first, between <i>strangers</i>, as a simple domestic
make-shift arrangement, often arising from the
necessities of a new country, and by no means
peculiar to America; and, secondly, between
<i>lovers</i>, who shared the same couch, with the
mutual understanding that innocent endearments
<a name="Page_14"></a>should not be exceeded. It was, however, in
either case, a custom of convenience.</p>

<p>We may notice, in this connection, that it is
very common, even at the present day, in New
England, to speak of one as having &quot;bundled in
with his clothes on,&quot; if he goes to bed without
undressing; as, for instance, if he came home
drunk, or feeling slightly ill, lay down in the
daytime, or in a cold night found the blankets
too scanty.</p>

<p>The point which first claims our attention in
the discussion of this custom, is its probable
<i>origin</i>, and its <i>antiquity</i> in</p>
<br />

<h4>THE BRITISH ISLES.</h4>

<br />

<p>For, though British travelers have uniformly endeavored
to fix the odium of this custom upon
us their transatlantic cousins, as being peculiarly
&quot;An American institution,&quot; it is, nevertheless,
an indisputable fact that bundling has for centuries
flourished within their own kingdom.
<a name="Page_15"></a>For what else, in fact, was that universal custom
of promiscuous sleeping together which prevailed
among the ancient Britons at the time of the
Roman conquest, and which led C&aelig;sar to consider
them as polyandrous polygamists, and other
ancient writers to give them an unenviable character
for morality?<a name="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1">[1]</a> Bundling, of course! in
its rudest aboriginal form.</p>

<p>As to its moral aspects, being more charitably
inclined towards our British friends than they
oftentimes are to us, we are willing to accept
Logan's defense of their ancestors. &quot;The custom,&quot;
he says, &quot;which continued until lately in
some parts, and yet exists among a few of the
<a name="Page_16"></a>rudest, who sleep altogether on straw or rushes,
according to the general ancient practice, there
is reason to believe, led to the aspersion cast on
the British and Irish tribes. How natural it
must have been for a casual observer to suppose,
from seeing men and women reposing in the
same place, that the marriage rites were not in
force. To judge of the ancient inhabitants by
the rudest of the present Highlanders and Irish,
who often sleep in the same apartment, and are
sometimes exposed to each other in a state of
semi-nudity, we should not come to a conclusion
unfavorable to their morality,<a name="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2">[2]</a> for this mode of
<a name="Page_17"></a>life is not productive of that conjugal infidelity
which St. Jerome and others insinuate as preva<a name="Page_18"></a>lent
among the old Scots. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Nations
that are even in a savage state are sometimes
<a name="Page_19"></a>found more sensitive on that point of honor than
nations more advanced in civilization; and all,
<a name="Page_20"></a>perhaps, that can be admitted is, that certain
formalities may have been practiced by the
Britons, from which the <i>bundling</i> of the Welsh,
and the <i>hand-fasting</i> in some parts of Scotland,
are derived. The conversation which took place
between the Empress Julia and the wife of a
Caledonian chief, as related by Xiphilin, cer<a name="Page_21"></a>tainly
evinces a grossness and indelicacy in the
amours of the British ladies, if true; but it appears
to be a reply where wit and reproof were
more aimed at than truth. The case of the Empress
Cartismandua shows the nice feeling of the
Britons as to the propriety of female conduct.
The respect of the Germans for their females,
and the severity with which they visited a deviation
from virtue, have been described; and the
further testimony of Tacitus may be adduced,
who says that but very few of the greatest dignity
chose to have more than one wife, and when
they did it was merely for the honor of alliance.
It may be here stated that the Ga&euml;ls have no
word to express cuckold, and that prostitutes
were, by Scots' law, like that of the ancient
Germans, thrown into deep wells; and a woman
was not permitted to complain of an assault if
she allowed more than one night to elapse before
the accusation.&quot;&mdash;<i>Logan's Scottish Ga&euml;l</i>, 5th Am.
edition, p. 472.<a name="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5">[5]</a></p>

<p><a name="Page_22"></a>Indeed, whatever may have been the real state
of morality among the ancient Scotch and Irish&mdash;and
it is quite probable that it has been unfairly
depicted by casual and prejudiced observers&mdash;the
ancient custom of bundling, which has been
handed down from earliest times, has not greatly
contaminated their descendants of the present
day. For, whatever their national vices, the
Scotch and Irish of our day maintain a character
for chastity superior to that of many of their
more fortunate and more civilized neighbors.
Bundling, as now practiced in these kingdoms, is
<a name="Page_23"></a>merely a matter arising from the ignorance, or
the poverty of the inhabitants; and, while not
salutary in its moral or physical influence, is, at
all events, less abused than we might reasonably
expect.</p>

<p>In regard to</p>
<br />

<h4>WALES.</h4>
<br />

<p>We learn from Woodward's admirable history
of that kingdom, the following facts concerning
the domestic habits of its people in the twelfth
century:</p>

<p>&quot;At night a bed of rushes was laid down along
one side of the room, covered with a coarse kind
of cloth, made in the country, called <i>brychan;</i>
and all the household lay down on this bed in
common, without changing their dresses. The
fire was kept burning through the night, and the
sleepers maintained their warmth by lying
closely; and when, by the hardness of their
couch, one side was wearied, they would get up and
<a name="Page_24"></a>sit by the fire awhile, and then lie down again on
the other side. It is to this custom of promiscuous
sleeping, that some of the worst habits of the
Welsh at the present day may be ascribed; and
from the same custom which their forefathers,
the ancient Britons, practiced, arose C&aelig;sar's
supposition that they were polyandrous polygamists.&quot;</p>

<p>These habits, which were a matter of necessity
with the ancient Welsh, have become converted,
by the lapse of time, among their descendants
of the present day, into an amatory
custom precisely similar to that practiced formerly
in New England.<a name="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6">[6]</a></p>

<p><a name="Page_25"></a>A tourist through Wales, in the year 1797,<a name="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7">[7]</a>
thus speaks of the Welsh <i>bundling</i>: &quot;And here,
amongst the usages and customs, I must not
omit to inform you that what you have, perhaps,
often heard, without believing, respecting the
<i>mode of courtship</i> amongst the Welsh peasants, is
true. The lower order of people do actually
carry on their love affairs in bed, and what would
extremely astonish more polished lovers, they
are carried on honorably, it being, at least, as
usual for the Pastoras of the mountains to go
from the bed of courtship to the bed of marriage
as unpolluted and maidenly as the Chloes of
fashion; and yet you are not to conclude that
this proceeds from their being less susceptible of
the <i>belle-passion</i> than their betters; or that the
cold air which they breathe has 'froze the genial
current of their souls.' By no means; if they
<a name="Page_26"></a>cannot boast the voluptuous languor of an Italian
sky, they glow with the bracing spirit of a more
invigorating atmosphere. I really took some
pains to investigate this curious custom, and
after being assured, by many, of its veracity, had
an opportunity of attesting its existence with my
own eyes. The servant maid of the family I
visited in Caernarvonshire, happened to be the
object of a young peasant, who walked eleven
long miles every Sunday morning to favor his
suit, and regularly returned the same night
through all weathers, to be ready for Monday's
employment in the fields, being simply a day
laborer. He usually arrived in time for morning
service, which he constantly attended, after
which he escorted his Dulcinea home to the
house of her master, by whose permission they
as constantly passed the succeeding hour in bed,
according to the custom of the country. These
tender sabbatical preliminaries continued without
interruption near two years, when the treaty
of alliance was solemnized, and, so far from any
<a name="Page_27"></a>breach of articles happening in the meantime, it
is most likely that it was considered by both
parties as a matter of course, without exciting
any other idea. On speaking to my friend on
the subject, he observed that, though it certainly
appeared a dangerous mode of making love, he
had seen so few <i>living</i> abuses of it, during six
and thirty years' residence in that country, where
it nevertheless had always, more or less, prevailed,
he must conclude it was as innocent as any
other. One proof of its being <i>thought</i> so by the
parties, is the perfect ease and freedom with
which it is done; no awkwardness or confusion
appearing on either side; the most well-behaved
and decent young woman going into it without a
blush, and they are by no means deficient in modesty.
What is pure in idea is always so in conduct,
since bad actions are the common consequence
of bad thoughts; and though the better
sort of people treat this ceremony as a barbarism,
it is very much to be doubted whether more <i>faux
pas</i> have been committed by the Cambrian boors
<a name="Page_28"></a>in this <i>free access</i> to the bed chambers of their
mistresses, than by more fashionable Strephons
and their nymphs in groves and shady bowers.
The power of habit is perhaps stronger than the
power of passion, or even of the charms which
inspire it; and it is sufficient, almost, to say a
thing is the <i>custom of a country</i>, to clear it from
any reproach that would attach to an innovation.
Were it the practice of a few only, and to be
gratified by stealth, there would, from the strange
construction of human nature, be more cause of
suspicion; but being ancient, general, and carried
on without difficulty, it is probably as little dangerous
as a <i>t&ecirc;te a t&ecirc;te</i> in a drawing-room, or in
any other full dress place where young people
meet to say soft things to each other.&quot;</p>

<p>In an antiquarian tour by the Rev. W. Bingley,
in 1804,<a name="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8">[8]</a> we also find the following description
of this custom: &quot;The peasantry of part of
<a name="Page_29"></a>Caernarvonshire, Anglesea, and Merionethshire,
adopt a mode of <i>courtship</i> which, till within the
last few years, was scarcely even heard of in
England. It is the same that is common in
many parts of America, and termed by the inhabitants
of that country, <i>bundling</i>. The lover
steals, under the shadow of the night, to the bed
of the fair one, into which (retaining an essential
part of his dress) he is admitted without any
shyness or reserve. Saturday or Sunday nights
are the principal times when this courtship takes
place, and on these nights the men sometimes
walk from a distance of ten miles or more to
visit their favorite damsels. This strange custom
seems to have originated in the scarcity of fuel,
and in the unpleasantness of sitting together in
the colder part of the year without a fire. Much
has been said of the innocence with which these
meetings are conducted, but it is a very common
thing for the consequence of the interview to
make its appearance in the world within two or
three months after the marriage ceremony has
<a name="Page_30"></a>taken place. The subject excites no particular
attention among the neighbors, provided the
marriage be made good before the living witness
is brought to light. Since this custom is entirely
confined to the laboring classes of the community,
it is not so pregnant with danger as, on a
first supposition, it might seem. Both parties
are so poor that they are necessarily constrained
to render their issue legitimate, in order to secure
their reputation, and with a mode of obtaining
a livelihood.&quot;</p>

<p>Another traveller<a name="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9">[9]</a> also mentions &quot;a singular
custom that is said to prevail in Wales, relating
to their mode of courtship, which is declared to
be carried on in bed; and, what is more extraordinary,
it is averred that the moving tale of
love is agitated in that situation without endangering
a breach in the preliminaries.&quot; Referring
to Mr. Pratt's account of the custom,
before quoted, he proceeds to remark:  &quot;Our
<a name="Page_31"></a>companion, like every one else that we spoke
with in Wales on the subject, at once denied the
existence of this custom: that maids in many
instances admitted male bed-fellows, he did not
doubt; but that the procedure was sanctioned
by <i>tolerated custom</i> he considered a gross misrepresentation.
Yet in Anglesea and some parts
of North Wales, where the original simplicity of
manners and high sense of chastity of the natives
is retained, he admitted <i>something of the kind</i>
might appear. In those thinly inhabited districts
a peasant often has several miles to walk after
the hours of labor, to visit his mistress; those
who have reciprocally entertained the <i>belle passion</i>
will easily imagine that before the lovers
grow tired of each other's company the night will
be far enough advanced; nor is it surprising that
a tender-hearted damsel should be disinclined to
turn her lover out over bogs and mountains until
the dawn of day. The fact is, that under
such circumstances she admits a <i>consors lecti</i>,
but not in <i>nudatum corpus</i>. In a lonely Welsh
<a name="Page_32"></a>hut this bedding has not the alarm of ceremony;
from sitting, or perhaps lying, on the hearth, they
have only to shift their quarters to a heap of
straw or fern covered with two or three blankets
in a neighboring corner. The practice only
takes place with <i>this view of accommodation</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>Still another glimpse of this favorite Welsh
custom is presented by a tourist in 1807.<a name="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10">[10]</a> He
says:</p>

<p>&quot;One evening, at an inn where we halted, we
heard a considerable bustle in the kitchen, and,
upon enquiry, I was let into a secret worth knowing.
The landlord had been scolding one of his
maids, a very pretty, plump little girl, for not
having done her work; and the reason which
she alleged for her idleness was, that her master
having locked the street door at night, had prevented
her lover enjoying the rights and delights
of <i>bundling</i>, an amatory indulgence which, considering
that it is sanctioned by custom, may be
<a name="Page_33"></a>regarded as somewhat singular, although it is not
exclusively of Welsh growth. The process is
very simple; the gay Lothario, when all is silent,
steals to the chamber of his mistress, who receives
him in bed, but with the modest precaution
of wearing her under petticoat, which is
always fastened at the bottom&mdash;not unfrequently,
I am told, by a sliding knot. It may astonish a
London gallant to be told that this extraordinary
experiment often ends in downright wedlock&mdash;the
knot which cannot slide. A gentleman of
respectability also assured me that he was obliged
to indulge his female servants in these nocturnal
interviews, and that too at all hours of the night,
otherwise his whole family would be thrown into
disorder by their neglect; the carpet would not
be dusted, nor would the kettle boil. I think
this custom should share the fate of the northern
Welsh goats. *&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* Habit has so reconciled
the mind to the comforts of <i>bundling</i>, that
a young lady who entered the coach soon after
we left Shrewsbury, about eighteen years of age,
<a name="Page_34"></a>with a serene and modest countenance, displayed
considerable historical knowledge of the custom,
without one touch of bashfulness.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11">[11]</a></p>

<p>Thus much for Wales, where the custom seems
to have been entirely confined to the lower
classes of society, and where we have reason to
think it still prevails to some extent to this day.<a name="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12">[12]</a></p>

<p><a name="Page_35"></a>The same author whom we last quoted also
speaks of a &quot;courtship similar to <i>bundling</i>, carried
on in the islands of Vlie and Wieringen,</p>
<br />

<h4>IN HOLLAND,</h4>
<br />

<p>Under the name of <i>queesting</i>.<a name="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15">[15]</a> At night the
lover has access to his mistress after she is in
bed; and, upon an application to be admitted
upon the bed, which of course is granted, he
raises the quilt, or rug, and in this state <i>queests</i>,
or enjoys a harmless chit-chat with her, and then
<a name="Page_36"></a>retires. This custom meets with the perfect
sanction of the most circumspect parents, and
the freedom is seldom abused. The author
traces its origin to the parsimony of the people,
whose economy considers fire and candles as superfluous
luxuries in the long winter evenings.&quot;</p>

<p>The Hon. Henry C. Murphy of Brooklyn,
N.&nbsp;Y., late United States minister at the Hague,
has furnished us with the following note in relation
to this Nederduitsche custom: &quot;As to
its being a Dutch custom, it was so to a limited
extent in Holland in former times, and may yet
be, though I did not hear of it when I was there.
Sewell gives the word <i>queesten</i>, or <i>kweesten</i>, in
his dictionary, printed over a century ago. The
word is defined in the dictionary of Wieland, the
principal lexicographer in that country, as follows:
'<i>Kweesten</i>. Upon the islands of Texel
and Vlieland<a name="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16">[16]</a> they use this word for a singular
custom of wooing, by which the doors and
<a name="Page_37"></a>windows are left open, and the lover, lying or
sitting outside the covering, woos the girl who is
underneath.' Sewell confines the custom to certain
islands or lands near the sea.&quot;</p>

<h4>LOVE AND COURTSHIP IN THE 14TH CENTURY.</h4>
<br />

<p>In feudal times, in the last part of the fourteenth
century, it became the practice for the
vassals, or feudatories, to send their sons to be
educated in the family of the suzerain, while the
daughters were similarly placed with the lady of
the castle. These formed a very important part
of the household, and were of gentle blood,
claiming the honorary title of <i>chambri&eacute;res</i> or
chamber-maidens. The demoiselles of this period
were very susceptible to the passion of love,
which was the ruling spirit of the inmates of the
castle. Feudal society was, in comparison to
the previous times, polished and even brilliant,
but it was not, under the surface, pure. Many
good maxims were taught, but they were not all
practiced.  &quot;There was an extreme intimacy
<a name="Page_38"></a>between the two sexes, who commonly visited
each other in their chambers or bedrooms.
Thus in the poem of Guatier d'Aupias, the hero
is represented as visiting in her chamber the
demoiselle of whom he is enamored. Numerous
similar examples might be quoted. At times,
one of the parties is described as being actually
in bed, as is the case in the romance of <i>Blonde of
Oxford</i>, where Blonde visits Jehan in his chamber
when he is in bed, and stays all night with
him, in perfect innocence as we are told in the
romance. We must remember that it was the
custom in those times for both sexes to go to bed
perfectly naked.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17">[17]</a></p>
<br />

<h4>IN SWITZERLAND,</h4>
<br />

<p>According to an English observer,<a name="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18">[18]</a> analogous
modes of courtship still exist. In speaking of
<a name="Page_39"></a>the canton <i>Unterwald</i> he says: &quot;In the story of
the destruction of the castles, we read that the
surprise was effected by a young girl admitting
her lover to her room by a ladder, and an English
guide-book remarks, that this is still the fashion
of receiving lovers in Switzerland. Reference
is had to the manner of wooing, which in some
cantons is called <i>lichtgetren</i>, in others <i>dorfen</i> and
<i>stubetegetren</i>, and answers to the old-fashioned
<i>going-a-courting</i> in England. The customs connected
with it vary in different cantons, but exist
in some form in all except two or three.</p>

<p>In the canon <i>Lucerne</i>, the <i>kiltgang</i> is the universal
mode of wooing; the lover visiting his
betrothed in the evening, to be pelted on the way
by all mischievous urchins; or if he is seated
quietly with her by the winter fire, they are sure
to be serenaded by all manner of <i>cat voices</i> under
the window, which are continued till he issues
forth, perhaps at dawn in the morning; and however
long may be a courtship, these <i>cater-waulings</i>
are the invariable attendants, and not the
<a name="Page_40"></a>most lamentable consequences of these nightly
visits, recognized, however, as entirely respectable
and conventional in every canton.&quot;</p>

<p>And again in the canton <i>Vaud</i>, he says, &quot;the
<i>kiltgang</i>, or nightly wooings, are the universal
custom with the universal consequences, but in
general the wife is treated with marked respect,
is made keeper of the treasury, and consulted as
the oracle of the family.&quot;</p>

<p>Among the amatory customs of various</p>
<br />

<h4>SAVAGE NATIONS</h4>
<br />

<p>and tribes, there are certain which somewhat
resemble <i>bundling</i>, except in the greater degree
of freedom allowed&mdash;a freedom which, in the
eyes of civilized nations, is absolute immorality.
Of this description is the manner of wooing
described by La Hontan as prevalent among the
Indians of North America.<a name="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19">[19]</a></p>

<p><a name="Page_41"></a>Yet, in many of these instances, if we were
to carefully examine the social system and customs
of our savage friends, and were willing to
judge them rather by the results of our own observation,
than by our preconceived opinions, we
should probably find that the absolute <i>practical
morality</i> of these <i>untutored natives</i>, was quite
equal, if not superior, to that of the educated
and civilized whites.<a name="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20">[20]</a></p>

<p><a name="Page_42"></a>Among these <i>customs de amour</i>, however, to
which we have alluded as existing among different
savage tribes, there are none which bear so perfect
a resemblance to <i>bundling</i>, as that described
by Masson in his <i>Journeys in Central Asia, Belochistan,
Afghanistan,</i> etc. (III, 287.) He says:</p>

<p>&quot;Many of the Afghan tribes have a custom of
wooing similar to what in Wales is known as <i>bundling-up</i>,
and which they term <i>namzat bez&eacute;</i>. The
lover presents himself at the house of his betrothed
with a suitable gift, and in return is allowed
to pass the night with her, on the understanding
that innocent endearments are not to be
exceeded.&quot;</p>

<p>Spencer St. John tells us, in speaking of the
piratical and ferocious Sea Dayaks of Borneo,
that &quot;besides the ordinary attention which a
<a name="Page_43"></a>young man is able to pay to the girl he desires to
make his wife&mdash;as helping her in her farm work,
and in carrying home her load of vegetables or
wood, as well as in making her little presents, as
a ring or some brass chain-work with which the
women adorn their waists, or even a petticoat&mdash;there
is a very peculiar testimony of regard
which is worthy of note. About nine or ten at
night, when the family is supposed to be fast
asleep within the musquito curtains in the private
apartments, the young man quietly slips
back the bolt by which the door is fastened on
the inside, and enters the room on tiptoe. On
hearing who it is, she rises at once, and they sit
conversing together and making arrangements for
the future, in the dark, over a plentiful supply of
<i>sirih-leaf</i> and <i>batle-nut</i>, which it is the gentleman's
duty to provide, for his suit is in a fair way
to prosper; but if, on the other hand, she rises
and says, 'be good enough to blow up the fire,'
or 'light the lamp' (a bamboo filled with resin),
then his hopes are at an end, as that is the usual
<a name="Page_44"></a>form of dismissal. Of course, if this kind of
nocturnal visit is frequently repeated, the parents
do not fail to discover it, although it is a point of
honor among them to take no notice of their
visitor; and, if they approve of him, matters
then take their course, but if not, they use their
influence with their daughter to ensure the utterance
of the fatal 'please blow up the fire.'&quot;</p>

<p>And now, having discussed the custom of
bundling as it formerly existed in Great Britain,
and having proved its identity with the <i>queesting</i>
of Holland, and the <i>namzat bez&eacute;</i> of Central Asia,
we propose to follow our investigations to the
continent of America, and to trace, if we can,
its origin and progress in the</p>
<br />

<h4>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,</h4>
<br />

<p>in doing which, it is quite likely that, we follow
the identical line of travel and colonization&mdash;viz:
from Old to New England, and from Netherlands
(the father-land) to New Nether<a name="Page_45"></a>lands&mdash;by
which the custom of bundling was
really transplanted to these western shores. For,
although the grave and (sometimes) veracious
historian of New York, Diedrich Knickerbocker,
hath endeavored to fasten upon the Connecticut
settlers the odium of having introduced the
custom into New Netherland,<a name="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21">[21]</a> to the great
offense of all properly disposed people; yet we
may reasonably doubt whether the young mynheers
and frauliens of New Amsterdam, in that
day, were any more innocent of this lover's pastime,
than their vivacious Connecticut neighbors.
Indeed, can it be for one moment sup<a name="Page_46"></a>posed
that the good Hollanders&mdash;a most unchanging
and conservative race&mdash;should have
been so far false to the traditions of their
fathers, and the honor of the fatherland, as to
leave behind them, when they crossed the seas,
the good old custom of <i>queesting</i>, with its time-honored
associations and delights? Or can it be
imagined that those astute lawgivers and political
economists, the early governors and burgomasters,
were so blind to the necessities and
interests of a new and sparsely populated country,
as to forbid bundling within their borders?
Indeed, it would be but a sorry compliment to
the wisdom of that sagacious and far-sighted
body of merchants comprised in the High and
Mighty West India Company, to believe that
they were unwilling to introduce under their
benign auspices, a custom so intimately connected
with their own national social habits, and so
promising to the prospective interests and enlargement
of their <i>new plantations</i>, as this. And, truly,
Diedrich himself, doth, in another part of his
<a name="Page_47"></a>book, inadvertently betray the fact that bundling
was by no means a purely Yankee trick, for he
speaks of the redoubtable Anthony Van Corlaer&mdash;purest
of Dutchmen&mdash;as &quot;passing through
Hartford, and Pyquag, and Middletown, and all
the other border towns, twanging his trumpet like
a very devil, so that the sweet valleys and banks
of the Connecticut resounded with the warlike
melody, and stopping occasionally to eat pumpkin
pies, dance at country frolics, and <i>bundle</i> with the
beauteous lasses of those parts, whom he rejoiced
exceedingly with his soul-stirring instrument.&quot;
Which passage, while it proves that the practice
of bundling prevailed in Connecticut, proves
equally well that Anthony the trumpeter was by
no means inexperienced in its delights, nor unwilling
to enjoy its comforts, whether under the
name of <i>bundling</i> or <i>queesting</i>.</p>

<p>Indeed, we do most truly believe that the cunning
Knickerbocker, in his desire to vindicate, as
he thought, the character of his race against the
accusation of immorality, hath by his denial not
<a name="Page_48"></a>only committed a grievous sin against &quot;the truth
of history,&quot; but hath greatly added thereto, by
attempting to foist off the opprobrium of the
same on to the shoulders of the Connecticut
folks. But history will not remain forever falsified,
and the day has at length arrived when
every historical tub must &quot;stand on its own bottom,&quot;
and the world will henceforth know that
the New Netherlanders did not take bundling by
inoculation from the Yankees, but that they
brought it with them to the New World, as an
ancestral heirloom.</p>

<p>This point being thus satisfactorily settled, to
the honor of the Dutchman, and the extreme satisfaction
of all future historians, we next proceed
to investigate the bundling prevalent in</p>
<br />

<h4>THE NEW ENGLAND STATES,</h4>
<br />

<p>Where, as we have already shown, it was, as
with the Dutchmen, an <i>inherited</i> custom. Its
comparatively innocent and harmless character
has, however, been fearfully distorted and ma<a name="Page_49"></a>ligned
by irresponsible satirists, and prejudiced
historians. Take, for example, the following
passage from Knickerbocker's <i>History of New
York</i>,<a name="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22">[22]</a> wherein he pretends to describe &quot;the
curious device among these sturdy barbarians
[the Connecticut colonists], to keep up a harmony
of interests, and promote population.
*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* They multiplied to a degree which
would be incredible to any man unacquainted
with the marvellous fecundity of this growing
country. This amazing increase may, indeed,
be partly ascribed to a singular custom prevalent
among them, commonly known by the name of
<i>bundling</i>&mdash;a superstitious rite observed by the
young people of both sexes, with which they
usually terminated their festivities, and which
was kept up with religious strictness by the more
bigoted and vulgar part of the community. This
ceremony was likewise, in those primitive times,
considered as an indispensable preliminary to
<a name="Page_50"></a>matrimony; their courtships commencing where
ours usually finish, by which means they acquired,
that intimate acquaintance with each
other's good qualities before marriage, which has
been pronounced by philosophers the sure basis of
a happy union. Thus early did this cunning and
ingenious people display a shrewdness at making
a bargain, which has ever since distinguished
them, and a strict adherence to the good old
vulgar maxim about 'buying a pig in a poke.'</p>

<p>&quot;To this sagacious custom, therefore, do I
chiefly attribute the unparalleled increase of the
Yanokie or Yankee tribe; for it is a certain fact,
well authenticated by court records and parish
registers, that wherever the practice of bundling
prevailed, there was an amazing number of sturdy
brats annually born unto the state, without
the license of the law, or the benefit of clergy.
Neither did the irregularity of their birth operate
in the least to their disparagement. On
the contrary, they grew up a long-sided, raw-boned,
hardy race of whoreson whalers, wood
<a name="Page_51"></a>cutters, fishermen, and peddlers; and strapping
corn-fed wenches, who by their united efforts
tended marvellously towards populating those
notable tracts of country called Nantucket,
Piscataway, and Cape Cod.&quot;</p>

<p>Hear, also, that learned, but audacious and
unscrupulous divine, the Rev. Samuel Peters,
who thus discourseth at length upon the custom
of bundling in Connecticut, and other parts of
New England. After admitting that &quot;the women
of Connecticut are strictly virtuous, and to be
compared to the prude rather than the European
polite lady,&quot; he says:</p>

<p>&quot;Notwithstanding the modesty of the females
is such that it would be accounted the greatest
rudeness for a gentleman to speak before a lady
of a garter, knee, or leg, yet it is thought but a
piece of civility to ask her to <i>bundle;</i> a custom
as old as the first settlement in 1634. It is certainly
innocent, virtuous and prudent, or the
puritans would not have permitted it to prevail
among their offspring, for whom in general they
<a name="Page_52"></a>would suffer crucifixion. Children brought up
with the chastest ideas, with so much religion as
to believe that the omniscient God sees them in
the dark, and that angels guard them when absent
from their parents, will not, nay, cannot, act
a wicked thing. People who are influenced more
by lust, than a serious faith in God, who is too
pure to behold iniquity with approbation, ought
never to <i>bundle</i>. If any man, thus a stranger to
the love of virtue, of God, and the Christian
religion, should <i>bundle</i> with a young lady in New
England, and behave himself unseemly towards
her, he must first melt her into passion, and expel
heaven, death, and hell, from her mind, or
he will undergo the chastisement of negroes
turned mad&mdash;if he escape with life, it will be
owing to the parents flying from their bed to
protect him. The Indians, who had this method
of courtship when the English arrived among
them in 1634, are the most chaste set of people
in the world. Concubinage and fornication are
vices none of them are addicted to, except such
<a name="Page_53"></a>as forsake the laws of Hobbamockow and turn
Christians. The savages have taken many female
prisoners, carried them back three hundred
miles into their country, and kept them several
years, and yet not a single instance of their violating
the laws of chastity has ever been known.
This cannot be said of the French, or of the
English, whenever Indian or other women have
fallen into their hands. I am no advocate for
temptation; yet must say, that <i>bundling</i> has prevailed
160 years in New England, and, I verily
believe, with ten times more chastity than the
sitting on a sofa. I had daughters, and speak
from near forty years' experience. <i>Bundling</i>
takes place only in cold seasons of the year&mdash;the
sofa in summer is more dangerous than
the bed in winter. About the year 1756, Boston,
Salem, Newport, and New York, resolving
to be more polite than their ancestors, forbade
their daughters <i>bundling</i> on the bed with any
young man whatever, and introduced a sofa to
render courtship more palatable and Turkish,
<a name="Page_54"></a>whatever it was owing to, whether to the sofa,
or any uncommon excess of the <i>feu d'esprit</i>, there
went abroad a report that this <i>raffinage</i> produced
more <i>natural consequences</i> then all the <i>bundling</i> among
the boors with their <i>rurales pedantes</i>,
through every village in New England besides.</p>

<p>&quot;In 1776, a clergyman from one of the polite
towns, went into the country, and preached
against the unchristian custom of young men and
maidens lying together on a bed. He was no
sooner out of the church, then attacked by a
shoal of good old women, with, 'Sir, do you
think we and our daughters are naughty, because
we allow <i>bundling?</i>' 'You lead yourselves into
temptation by it.' They all replied at once, 'Sir,
have you been told thus, or has experience
taught it you?' The Levite began to lift up his
eyes, and to consider of his situation, and bowing,
said, 'I have been told so.' The ladies, <i>una
voce</i>, bawled out, 'Your informants, sir, we conclude,
are those city ladies who prefer a sofa to a
bed: we advise you to alter your sermon, by
<a name="Page_55"></a>substituting the word <i>sofa</i> for <i>bundling</i>, and on
your return home preach it to them, for experience
has told us that city folks send more
children into the country without fathers or
mothers to own them, than are born among us;
therefore, you see, a sofa is more dangerous than
a bed.' The poor priest, seemingly convinced
of his blunder, exclaimed, '<i>Nec vitia nostra, neo
remedia pati possumus</i>,' hoping thereby to get rid
of his guests; but an old matron pulled off her
spectacles, and, looking the priest in the face like
a Roman heroine, said, '<i>Noli putare me h&aelig;c auribus
tuis dare</i>.' Others cried out to the priest to
explain his Latin. 'The English,' said he, 'is
this: Wo is me that I sojourn in Meseck, and
dwell in the tents of Kedar!' One pertly retorted,
'<i>Gladii decussati sunt gemina presbyteri
clavis</i>.' The priest confessed his error, begged
pardon, and promised never more to preach
against bundling, or to think amiss of the custom;
the ladies generously forgave him, and
went away.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_56"></a>It may seem very strange to find this
custom of bundling in bed attended with so much innocence in New
England, while in Europe it is thought not safe or scarcely decent to
permit a young man and maid to be together in private anywhere. But in
this quarter of the old world the viciousness of the one, and the
simplicity of the other, are the result merely of education and habit.
It seems to be a part of heroism, among the polished nations of it, to
sacrifice the virtuous fair one, whenever an opportunity offers, and
thence it is concluded that the same principles actuate those of the new
world. It is egregiously absurd to judge all of all countries by one. In
Spain, Portugal and Italy, jealousy reigns; in France, England, and
Holland, suspicion; in the West and East Indies, lust; in New England,
superstition. These four blind deities govern Jews, Turks, Christians,
infidels, and heathen. Superstition is the most amiable. She sees no
vice with approbation but persecution, and self-preservation is the
cause of her seeing that. My <a name="Page_57"></a>insular readers will,
I hope, believe me, when I tell them that I have seen, in the West
Indies, naked boys and girls, some fifteen or sixteen years of age,
waiting at table and at tea, even when twenty or thirty virtuous English
ladies were in the room; who were under no more embarrassment at such an
awful sight in the eyes of English people that have not traveled abroad,
than they would have been at the sight of so many servants in livery.
Shall we censure the ladies of the West Indies as vicious above all
their sex, on account of this local custom? By no means; for long
experience has taught the world that the West Indian white ladies are
virtuous prudes. Where superstition reigns, fanaticism will be minister
of state; and the people, under the taxation of zeal, will shun what is
commonly called vice, with ten times more care than the polite and
civilized Christians, who know what is right and what is wrong from
reason and revelation. Happy would it be for the world, if reason and
revelation were suffered <a name="Page_58"></a>to control the mind and
passions of the great and wise men of the earth, as superstition does
that of the simple and less polished! When America shall erect societies
for the promotion of chastity in Europe, in return for the establishment
of European arts in the American capitals, then Europe will discover
that there is more Christian philosophy in American bundling than can be
found in the customs of nations more polite.</p>

<p>"I should not have said so
much about bundling, had not a learned divine<a name="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23">[23]</a> of the English church
published his travels through some parts of America, wherein this
remarkable custom is represented in an unfavorable light, and as
prevailing among the <i>lower class</i> of people. The truth is, the custom
prevails among all classes, to the great honor of the country, its
religion, and ladies. The virtuous may be tempted; but the tempter is
despised. Why it should be thought <a name="Page_59"></a>incredible for a young man and young
woman innocently and virtuously to lie down together in a bed with a
great part of their clothes on, I cannot conceive. Human passions may be
alike in every region; but religion, diversified as it is, operates
differently in different countries. Upon the whole, had I daughters now,
I would venture to let them <i>bundle</i> on the bed, or even on the sofa,
after a proper education, sooner than adopt the Spanish mode of forcing
young people to prattle only before the lady's mother the chitchat of
artless lovers. Could the four quarters of the world produce a more
chaste, exemplary and beautiful company of wives and daughters than are
in Connecticut, I should not have remaining one favorable sentiment for
the province. But the soil, the rivers, the ponds, the ten thousand
landscapes, together with the virtuous and lovely women which now adorn
the ancient kingdoms of Connecticote, Sassacus, and Quinnipiog, would
tempt me into the highest wonder and admiration of them, could they once
be freed of<a name="Page_60"></a>the skunk, the moping-owl, rattlesnake
and fanatic Christian.&quot;</p>

<p>Or, to take another example of the abuse
heaped by our English cousins upon this so-called
&quot;American custom of bundling.&quot; We extract
the following from an article entitled <i>British
Abuse of American Manners</i>, published in 1815.<a name="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24">[24]</a>
It seems that it had long been a custom in the
Westminster school, in the city of London, for
the senior students, who were about to leave that
seminary for the university, at the age of sixteen
to eighteen, to have an annual dramatic performance,
which was generally a play of Terence.<a name="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25">[25]</a>
To this, as annually performed, there was usually
a Latin prologue, and also an epilogue composed
for the occasion and this epilogue turned, for
the most part, on the manners of the day that
<a name="Page_61"></a>would bear the gentle correction of good humored
satire, in elegant Latinity. In the epilogue presented
at one of these exhibitions, about 1815,
in connection with the performance of Terence's
<i>Phormio</i>, the following balderdash (with much
else, as applied to American life and manners)
was introduced and spoken by these ingenuous
and virtuous British youth, before a large and
enlightened audience:</p>

<p><a name="Page_62"></a>Which being translated is as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;Nor is it easy to say whether the tenor of
their manners is more to be admired for simplicity
or elegance; a negro wench, as we are
told, will wait on her master at table in native
nudity; and a beau will strip himself to the
waist, that he may dance unincumbered, and
with more agility. There, too, we hear of the
practice of <i>bundling</i> without any infraction of
female modesty; and the chaste maiden, without
any deception, but with right good will, ventures
to share the bed with her chaste swain! Oh,
what nights and banquets, worthy of the gods!
What delightful customs among these pious
people?&quot;</p>

<p>But this spirit of misrepresentation and ridicule,
so glaringly apparent in the foregoing extracts,
and which has so universally characterized
all those British travelers and authors who have
attempted to describe our social habits and manners,
is fitly rebuked, even as long ago as 1815,
by an anonymous writer, whose trenchant pen
<a name="Page_63"></a>reminds our British cousins of the old adage concerning
&quot;those who live in glass houses,&quot; etc.</p>

<p>&quot;From the time of Jack Cade,&quot; says he, &quot;to
Lord George Gordon, and down to the present
day, neither your <i>grave</i> or <i>gay</i> authorities on the
subject of <i>bundling</i> and <i>tarrying</i> are worthy of
criticism. There is a littleness in noticing, in the
<i>London Quarterly Review</i>, a work which heretofore
has been distinguished for its taste, chasteness
and celebrity, the observation of travelers
who, if men of truth, could only mean to mention
customs (if they were customs) of the most
vulgar and ignorant, which at any rate are now
as little known as are the operation of the blue
laws of Connecticut, or part of the penal code
enacted to keep in slavery and subjection the
sister kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26">[26]</a></p>

<p>&quot;Englishmen, examine your own cottages, particularly
in the north, and on the borders, and
extend your view to the western extremity of
<a name="Page_64"></a>your island. Pray, what term will you give to
that promiscuous bundling of the father, mother,
children, sons and daughters-in-law, cousins, and
inmates who call to <i>tarry</i>, and not unfrequently
stretch themselves in one common bed of straw
on the hovel's floor?<a name="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27">[27]</a></p>

<p>&quot;Nay, even, in some parts of your empire,
the hogs and the cows join the group, and form
a most audible respiration from their noses, getting
vent through the hole in the roof intended
for a chimney, or spreading throughout the clay
built edifice with odorific sweetness, though perhaps
not so fragrant and refreshing as was the
precious oil poured on the venerable head of
Aaron, which Sternhold and Hopkins tell us
filled the room with pleasure. In the early settlement
of this country there might have been
houses in the route of the inquisitive and insidi<a name="Page_65"></a>ous
European travelers, unprovided with a spare
bed on which he might stretch his limbs; but,
now, should Mr. Canning<a name="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28">[28]</a> himself visit us, he
need not fear being <i>bundled</i>&mdash;he need not travel
far in any part of the United States without enjoying
the luxury of a soft couch and clean
sheets, where he can ruminate on the injustice
he attempts on our national character.&quot;</p>

<p>Badinage, ridicule and misrepresentation aside,
however, there can be no reasonable doubt that
<i>bundling</i> did prevail to a very great extent in
the New England colonies from a very early
date. It is equally evident that it was originally
confined almost entirely to the lower classes of
the community, or to those whose limited means
compelled them to economize strictly in their
expenditure of firewood and candlelight. Many,
perhaps the majority, of the dwellings of the
early settlers, consisted of but one room, in
which the whole family lived and slept. Yet
<a name="Page_66"></a>their innocent and generous hospitality forbade
that the stranger, or the friend whom night overtook
on their threshold, should be turned shelterless
and couchless away, so long as they could
offer him even half of a bed. As an example of
this we may cite the case of Lieut. Anbury, a
British officer, who served in America during
the Revolutionary War, and whose letters preserve
many sprightly and interesting pictures of
the manners and customs of that period. In a
letter dated at Cambridge, New England, November
20, 1777, he thus speaks:</p>

<p>&quot;The night before we came to this town
[Williamstown, Mass.], being quartered at a
small log hut, I was convinced in how innocent
a view the Americans look upon that indelicate
custom they call <i>bundling</i>. Though they have
remarkable good feather beds, and are extremely
neat and clean, still I preferred my hard mattress,
as being accustomed to it; this evening, however,
owing to the badness of the roads, and the
weakness of my mare, my servant had not
<a name="Page_67"></a>arrived with my baggage at the time for retiring
to rest. There being only two beds in the house,
I inquired which I was to sleep in, when the
old woman replied, 'Mr. Ensign,' here I should
observe to you, that the New England people
are very inquisitive as to the rank you have
in the army; 'Mr. Ensign,' says she, 'our Jonathan
and I will sleep in this, and our Jemima
and you shall sleep in that.' I was much astonished
at such a proposal, and offered to sit up
all night, when Jonathan immediately replied,
'Oh, la! Mr. Ensign, you wont be the first man
our Jemima has bundled with, will it Jemima?'
when little Jemima, who, by the bye, was a very
pretty, black-eyed girl, of about sixteen or seventeen,
archly replied, 'No, father, not by many,
but it will be with the first Britainer' (the name
they give to Englishmen). In this dilemma what
could I do? The smiling invitation of pretty
Jemima&mdash;the eye, the lip, the&mdash;Lord ha' mercy,
where am I going to? But wherever I may
be going now, I did not go to bundle with
<a name="Page_68"></a>her&mdash;in the same room with her father and
mother, my kind <i>host</i> and <i>hostess</i> too! I thought
of that&mdash;I thought of more besides&mdash;to struggle
with the passions of nature; to clasp Jemima
in my arms&mdash;to&mdash;do what? you'll ask&mdash;why,
to do&mdash;nothing! for if amid all these temptations,
the lovely Jemima had melted into kindness,
she had been an outcast from the world&mdash;treated
with contempt, abused by violence, and
left perhaps to perish! No, Jemima; I could have
endured all this to have been blest with you,
but it was too vast a sacrifice, when you was to
be the victim! Suppose how great the test of
virtue must be, or how cold the American constitution,
when this unaccountable custom is in
hospitable repute, and perpetual practice.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29">[29]</a></p>

<p>Again, in a subsequent letter, the Lieutenant,
after describing a New England sleighing frolic,
says: &quot;In England this would be esteemed
<a name="Page_69"></a>extremely imprudent, and attended with dangerous
consequences; but, after what I have related
respecting <i>bundling</i>, I need not say, in how
innocent a view this is looked upon. Apropos,
as to that custom, along the sea coast, by a continual
intercourse among Europeans, it is in some
measure abolished; but they still retain one
something similar, which is termed <i>tarrying</i>.
When a young man is enamored of a woman,
and wishes to marry her, he proposes the affair
to her parents (without whose consent no marriage,
in this colony, can take place); if they
have no objections, he is allowed to tarry with
her one night, in order to make his court. At
the usual time the old couple retire to bed, leaving
the young ones to settle matters as they can,
who having sat up as long as they think proper,
get into bed together also, but without putting
off their under garments; to prevent scandal. If
the parties agree, it is all very well, the banns
are published, and they married without delay;
if not, they part, and possibly never see each
<a name="Page_70"></a>other again, unless, which is an accident that
seldom happens, the forsaken fair proves pregnant,
in which case the man, unless he absconds,
is obliged to marry her, on pain of excommunication.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30">[30]</a></p>

<p>The word <i>tarry</i>, in the sense of <i>to stop</i> or <i>to
stay</i>, was more used by our ancestors than by the
present generation; yet we think that Lieut.
Anbury was mistaken in his idea that the <i>tarrying</i>
was but for a single night. It is true that
marriages were early, and probably the courtships
were short, but we all know enough of
New England <i>sparking</i> to know that a single
night was cutting it rather short; and yet it is
easy to see how Anbury should get his erroneous
idea. True, if the lover was so unlucky as to
get his final dismissal the first night, there was
an end of the matter, and well might they fail to
meet again; but, in that case, it is not likely that
the favors of which he could boast would be
<a name="Page_71"></a>such as to seriously affect the reputation of the
girl with whom he tarried. The fact that in the
custom of <i>tarrying</i>, the parties also <i>bundled</i>, does
not authorize the synonymous use of the two
words, which have nothing in common. For,
doubtless many young men <i>tarried</i> with their
sweethearts, who did not <i>bundle</i> with them.</p>

<p>Again, when, on a sabbath night, the faithful
swain arrived, having, perhaps, walked ten
or more weary miles, to enjoy the company of
his favorite lass, in the few brief hours which
would elapse before the morning light should call
him again to his homeward walk and his week of
toil, was it not the dictate of humanity as well
as of economy, which prompted the <i>old folks</i> to
allow the approved and accepted suitor of their
daughter to pursue his wooing under the downy
coverlid of a good feather bed (oftentimes, too,
in the very same room in which they themselves
slept), rather than to have them <i>sit up</i> and <i>burn
out uselessly</i> firewood and <i>candles</i>, to say nothing
of the risk of catching their <i>death a' cold?</i> In<a name="Page_72"></a>deed,
was not the sanction of bundling in such
cases a tacit admission, on the part of the parents,
of their perfect confidence in the young
folks, which necessarily acted upon the latter as,
at once, a strong restraint from wrong, and a
strong incentive to right doing? The influence
of early religious training, the powerful control
which the church had obtained upon the social
and domestic life of the people, and the superstitious
aspect which, in those days, the gospel was
made to wear, must also be taken into the
account. And, moreover, is it not probable
that the universality of the custom, which certainly
cleared it from anything like odium or
reproach, would naturally tend to preclude, in a
degree, any improper ideas in the minds of those
who practiced it? Such, then, we consider the
<i>status</i> of the custom in the earlier history of the
colonies, and among the <i>first generation</i> of settlers.</p>

<p>&quot;But,&quot; if the reader will allow us to quote
from a previous work, &quot;the emigration from a
<a name="Page_73"></a>civilized to a new country,<a name="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31">[31]</a> is necessarily a step
backward into barbarism. The <i>second generation</i>
did not fill the place of the fathers. Reared
amid the trials and dangers of a new settlement,
they were in a great measure deprived of the
advantages, both social and educational, which
their parents had enjoyed. Nearly all of the
former could write, which cannot be said of
their children. Neither did the latter possess
that depth of religious feeling, or earnest practical
piety which distinguished the first comers.
Religion was to them less a matter of the heart
than of social privilege, and in the <i>half way
covenant</i> controversy we behold the gradual <i>letting
down of bars</i> between a pure church and a
grasping world.</p>

<p>&quot;The <i>third</i> generation followed in the footsteps
of their predecessors. Then came war;
and young New England brought from the long
Canadian campaigns, stores of loose camp vices,
<a name="Page_74"></a>and recklessness, which soon flooded the land
with immorality and infidelity. The church was
neglected, drunkenness fearfully increased, and
social life was sadly corrupted.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32">[32]</a></p>

<p><a name="Page_75"></a>It is not, therefore, a matter of surprise that
bundling should, in the increased laxity of public
morals, become more frequently abused. Its
pernicious effects became constantly more apparent,
and more decidedly challenged the attention
of the comparatively few godly men who
endeavored to stem and to control the rapidly
widening current of immorality which threatened
to overwhelm the land.<a name="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33">[33]</a> The powerful intel<a name="Page_76"></a>lect
of Jonathan Edwards thundered its anathemas
upon it; pious divines prayed against it in
<a name="Page_77"></a>their closets, and wrestled with it in their pulpits;
while many attempted by a revision of
their church polity, by greater carefulness in the
admission of members; by rules more stringently
framed and enforced, to preserve, as best they
might, the purity of the churches committed to
their charge, and to make them, if it were possi<a name="Page_78"></a>ble,
beacon lights amid the surrounding darkness
of the times.<a name="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34">[34]</a> The task, however, was well nigh
hopeless. The French wars were succeeded by
that of the American Revolution, and not before
the close of that struggle, may the custom
of bundling be said to have received its deathblow,
and even then it <i>died hard</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Page_79"></a>Its final disuse was brought about by a variety
of causes, among which may be named the improved
condition of the people after the Revolution,
enabling many to live in larger and better
warmed houses, and in the very few places
where the ministers dared to touch the subject in
the pulpit, as in Dedham, already referred to, a
decided effect was produced, but it was confined
to the neighborhood, having very little effect on
the general custom. Probably no single thing
tended so much to break up the practice as the
publication of a song, or ballad, in an almanac,
about 1785.</p>

<p>This ballad described in a free and easy style
the various plans adopted by those who bundled,
and rather more than hinted at the results in certain
cases. Being published in an almanac, it
had a much larger circulation than could have
been obtained for it in any other way (tract societies
not being then in vogue), and the descriptions
were so <i>pat</i>, that each one who saw them
was disposed to apply them in a joking way to
<a name="Page_80"></a>any other who was known to practice bundling;
and the result was, such a general storm of
banter and ridicule that no girl had the courage
to stand against it, and continue to admit her
lovers to her bed.</p>

<p>We have found many persons who distinctly
remember the publication of this song, and the
effect which it had on the public mind, but all
our efforts to find the almanac containing it, have
proved of no avail.</p>

<p>We have, however, been favored with the use
of a broadside copy of a ballad, preserved among
the treasures of the American Antiquarian Society,
at Worcester, Massachusetts, which several
of our ancient friends have recognized as
identical with that in the almanac, one of them
proving it by repeating from memory several lines
from the Almanac version, which were precisely
like that of the broadside, a copy of which we
give herewith.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p><i>Or a reproof to those Young Country Women, who

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Since bundling very much abounds,<br /></span>
<span>In many parts in country towns,<br /></span>
<span>No doubt but some will spurn my song,<br /></span>
<span>And say I'd better hold my tongue;<br /></span>
<span>But none I'm sure will take offence,<br /></span>
<span>Or deem my song impertinence,<br /></span>
<span>But only those who guilty be,<br /></span>
<span>And plainly here their pictures see.<br /></span>
<span>Some maidens say, if through the nation,<br /></span>
<span>Bundling should quite go out of fashion,<br /></span>
<span>Courtship would lose its sweets; and they<br /></span>
<span>Could have no fun till wedding day.<br /></span>
<span>It shant be so, they rage and storm,<br /></span>
<span>And country girls in clusters swarm,<br /></span>
<span>And fly and buz, like angry bees,<br /></span>
<span>And vow they'll bundle when they please.<br /></span>
<span>Some mothers too, will plead their cause,<br /></span>
<span>And give their daughters great applause,<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_82"></a>And tell them, 'tis no sin nor shame,<br /></span>
<span>For we, your mothers, did the same;<br /></span>
<span>We hope the custom ne'er will alter,<br /></span>
<span>But wish its enemies a halter.<br /></span>
<span>Dissatisfaction great appear'd,<br /></span>
<span>In several places where they've heard<br /></span>
<span>Their preacher's bold, aloud disclaim<br /></span>
<span>That bundling is a burning shame;<br /></span>
<span>This too was cause of direful rout<br /></span>
<span>And talk'd and told of, all about,<br /></span>
<span>That ministers should disapprove<br /></span>
<span>Sparks courting in a bed of love,<br /></span>
<span>So justified the custom more,<br /></span>
<span>Than e'er was heard or known before.<br /></span>
<span>The pulpit then it seems must yield,<br /></span>
<span>And female valor take the field,<br /></span>
<span>In places where their custom long<br /></span>
<span>Increasing strength has grown so strong;<br /></span>
<span>When mothers herein bear a sway,<br /></span>
<span>And daughters joyfully obey.<br /></span>
<span>And young men highly pleased too,<br /></span>
<span>Good Lord! what can't the devil do.<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_83"></a>Can this vile practice ne'er be broke?<br /></span>
<span>Is there no way to give a stroke,<br /></span>
<span>To wound it or to strike it dead.<br /></span>
<span>And girls with sparks not go to bed<br /></span>
<span>'Twill strike them more than preacher's tongue,<br /></span>
<span>To let the world know what they've done<br /></span>
<span>And let it be in common fame,<br /></span>
<span>Held up to view a noted shame.<br /></span>
<span>Young miss if this your practice be,<br /></span>
<span>I'll teach you now yourself to see:<br /></span>
<span>You plead you're honest, modest too,<br /></span>
<span>But such a plea will never do;<br /></span>
<span>For how can modesty consist,<br /></span>
<span>With shameful practice such as this?<br /></span>
<span>I'll give your answer to the life:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;You don't undress, like man wife,&quot;<br /></span>
<span>That is your plea, I'll freely own,<br /></span>
<span>But whose your bondsmen when alone,<br /></span>
<span>That further rules you will not break,<br /></span>
<span>And marriage liberties partake?<br /></span>
<span>Some really do, as I suppose,<br /></span>
<span>Upon design keep on some clothes,<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_84"></a>And yet in truth I'm not afraid<br /></span>
<span>For to describe a bundling maid;<br /></span>
<span>She'll sometimes say when she lies down,<br /></span>
<span>She can't be cumber'd with a gown,<br /></span>
<span>And that the weather is so warm,<br /></span>
<span>To take it off can be no harm:<br /></span>
<span>The girl it seems had been at strift;<br /></span>
<span>For widest bosom to her shift,<br /></span>
<span>She gownless, when the bed they're in,<br /></span>
<span>The spark, nought feels but naked skin.<br /></span>
<span>But she is modest, also chaste,<br /></span>
<span>While only bare from neck to waist,<br /></span>
<span>And he of boasted freedom sings,<br /></span>
<span>Of all above her apron strings.<br /></span>
<span>And where such freedoms great are shar'd<br /></span>
<span>And further freedoms feebly bar'd,<br /></span>
<span>I leave for others to relate,<br /></span>
<span>How long she'll keep her virgin state.<br /></span>
<span>Another pretty lass we'll scan,<br /></span>
<span>That loves to bundle with a man,<br /></span>
<span>For many different ways they take,<br /></span>
<span>Through modest rules they all will break.<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_85"></a>Some clothes I'll keep on, she will say,<br /></span>
<span>For that has always been my way,<br /></span>
<span>Nor would I be quite naked found,<br /></span>
<span>With spark in bed, for thousand pound.<br /></span>
<span>But petticoats, I've always said,<br /></span>
<span>Were never made to wear in bed,<br /></span>
<span>I'll take them off, keep on my gown,<br /></span>
<span>And then I dare defy the town,<br /></span>
<span>To charge me with immodesty,<br /></span>
<span>While I so ever cautious be.<br /></span>
<span>The spark was pleased with his maid,<br /></span>
<span>Of apprehension quick he said,<br /></span>
<span>Her witty scheme was keen he swore,<br /></span>
<span>Lying in gown open before.<br /></span>
<span>Another maid when in the dark,<br /></span>
<span>Going to bed with her dear spark,<br /></span>
<span>She'll tell him that 'tis rather shocking,<br /></span>
<span>To bundle in with shoes and stockings.<br /></span>
<span>Nor scrupling but she's quite discreet,<br /></span>
<span>Lying with naked legs and feet,<br /></span>
<span>With petticoat so thin and short,<br /></span>
<span>That she is scarce the better for't;<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_86"></a>But you will say that I'm unfair,<br /></span>
<span>That some who bundle take more care,<br /></span>
<span>For some we may with truth suppose,<br /></span>
<span>Bundle in bed with all their clothes.<br /></span>
<span>But bundler's clothes are no defence,<br /></span>
<span>Unly<a name="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35">[35]</a> horses push the fence;<br /></span>
<span>A certain fact I'll now relate,<br /></span>
<span>That's true indeed without debate.<br /></span>
<span>A bundling couple went to bed.<br /></span>
<span>With all their clothes from foot to head,<br /></span>
<span>That the defence might seem complete,<br /></span>
<span>Each one was wrapped in a sheet.<br /></span>
<span>But O! this bundling's such a witch<br /></span>
<span>The man of her did catch the itch,<br /></span>
<span>And so provoked was the wretch,<br /></span>
<span>That she of him a bastard catch'd.<br /></span>
<span>Ye bundle misses don't you blush,<br /></span>
<span>You hang your heads and bid me hush.<br /></span>
<span>If you wont tell me how you feel,<br /></span>
<span>I'll ask your sparks, they best can tell.<br /></span>
<span><a name="Page_87"></a>But it is custom you will say,<br /></span>
<span>And custom always bears the sway,<br /></span>
<span>If I wont take my sparks to bed,<br /></span>
<span>A laughing stock I shall be made;<br /></span>
<span>A vulgar custom 'tis, I own,<br /></span>
<span>Admir'd by many a slut and clown,<br /></span>
<span>But 'tis a method of proceeding,<br /></span>
<span>As much abhorr'd by those of breeding.<br /></span>
<span>You're welcome to the lines I've penn'd,<br /></span>
<span>For they were written by a friend,<br /></span>
<span>Who'll think himself quite well rewarded,<br /></span>
<span>If this vile practice is discarded.<br /></span>

<p>Since this work went to press we have been
favored, by one of our antiquarian friends in
Massachusetts, with a copy of another poetical
blast against the practice of bundling. It was
written in the latter part of the last, or the first
decade of the present century, by a learned and
distinguished clergyman settled in Bristol county,
Massachusetts, who was a graduate of Harvard
University, and a doctor of divinity. The original
manuscript from which our copy is made, is
very carefully written out, with corrections apparently
of a later date, and now undoubtedly
appears for the first time in printed form.</p>

<span class="i3">How shameless you are grown.<br /></span>

<span class="i3">Upon the bed of shame;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i1">Because a smock and petticoat<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Have chance to lie between.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>4.   Such rank disgrace and scandal base,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">All modest youth will shun,<br /></span>

<span class="i3">And you will be undone.<br /></span>

<span>But modest girls should not wear tails<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor bristles any more.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span>7.  It is not strange that horses range<br /></span>

<span>But youthful lusts in fetters must<br /></span>

<p><a name="Page_106"></a>The evidence presented in the preceding pages,
establishes, as we think, the following facts:</p>

<p>1st. That the custom, so far as it pertained to
the American States, had its origin as a matter
of convenience and necessity.</p>

<p>2d. That in all stages of its history it was
chiefly confined to the humbler classes of society.</p>

<p>3d. That its prevalence may be said to have
closed with the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>It is our opinion that it came nearest to being
a universal custom from 1750 to 1780, and that
it was, at all times, regarded by the better classes
as a serious evil, and was no more countenanced
by them then the frequenting of grog
shops is by the better class of the present day.</p>

<p>This opinion is corroborated by the remarks
of several old persons whom we have consulted
as to their recollections of the custom. Among
these, Mr. B., of East Haddam, Ct., now in his
95th year, says that he well remembers it; that
it could not be called general, though frequent.
It was not practiced among the more intelligent,
<a name="Page_107"></a>educated classes, nor among those who lived in
large, well warmed houses. He says it was not
the fashion to bundle with any chap who might
call on a girl, but that it was a special favor,
granted only to a favorite lover, who might consider
it a proof of the high regard which the
damsel had for him; in short, it was <i>only accepted
lovers</i> who were thus admitted to the bed of the
fair one, and, as he expresses it, only after long
continued urging in most cases.<a name="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36">[36]</a> He thinks
the fashion ceased about 1790 to 1800, and in
consequence of education and refinement; and
that <i>no more mischief was done then than there
is now-a-days</i>.</p>

<p>In the same strain, also, spoke the genial
Colonel H., a native of Berlin, Ct., born in
1775. He was perfectly conversant with the
custom, had known the old ladies, in some cases,
to go up stairs before retiring, to see that the
bundling couple were comfortable, <i>tuck 'em up</i>,
<a name="Page_108"></a>and put on more bedclothes! And stoutly
asseverated his belief &quot;that there wasn't any
more mischief done in those days than there is
now.&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, all the old people with whom we have
conversed on the matter, although in some cases
a little unwilling to own that they had ever practiced
it themselves, were unanimous in their belief
that the abuse of chastity under the bundling
regime was no more frequent than it is now.
One old gentleman of whom we have heard, in
reply to the half reproachful, half joking question
of his grandson, whether he wasn't ashamed,
replied: &quot;Why, no! What is the use of sitting
up all night and burning out fire and lights,
when you could just as well get under kiver and
keep warm; and, when you get tired, take a nap
and wake up fresh, and go at it again? Why,
d&mdash;n it, there wasn't half as many bastards then
as there are now!&quot;<a name="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37">[37]</a></p>

<p><a name="Page_109"></a>Even within the present century we have found
traces of the continuance of the practice of
bundling, though the instances are perhaps few,
and in some measure exceptional. Until a very
late day the custom (as a matter of convenience)
was prevalent among the Dutch settlers of
Pennsylvania, and it is not improbable that
traces may still continue to exist in some of
the more remote counties of that state. An old
schoolmaster who flourished in Glastenbury, Ct.,
some twenty years ago, when relating his experiences
in teaching in southern Pennsylvania, and
speaking of <i>boarding around</i>, informed us that
when for any reason he did not choose to go to
his boarding place for the time being, he was
accustomed to stop at a tavern kept by an honest
old Dutchman. On one occasion, having asked
<a name="Page_110"></a>the landlord if he could stay over night, he was
told that he could; and after chatting with his
host through the evening, was shown to bed.
The landlord set down the candle and had gone
out of the room, when our friend noticed the
only bed in the room was already occupied, and
calling to the host, notified him of the fact;
when he cried back: &quot;Oh! dat ish only mine
taughter; she won't hurt nopoty,&quot; and coolly
went his way. And our friend affirmed that he
found the daughter not only harmless, but also
quite competent to take care of herself.</p>

<p>In New England, we believe that Cape Cod
has the dubious honor of holding out the longest
against the advance of civilization, bundling, as
we have it on good authority, having been practiced
there as late as 1827.<a name="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38">[38]</a>  In Greenwich,
<a name="Page_111"></a>New Jersey, it was in vogue in 1816. In the
state of New York this custom came under
judicial cognizance in the year 1804, when the
supreme court held, that although bundling was
admitted to be the custom in some parts of the
state, it being proven that the parents of the
girl, for whose seduction the suit was brought,
countenanced her practicing it, they had no
right to complain, or ask satisfaction for the consequences,
which, the court say, &quot;<i>naturally followed it!</i>&quot;<a name="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39">[39]</a></p>

<p>BUNDLING.</p>
<br />

<p>[From <i>The Yankee</i> of August 13, 1828, published at
Portland, Maine, and edited by John Neal.]</p>

<p>By Rochefoucault, in accounting for the populousness
of Massachusetts, the New Englanders
are charged with bundling.</p>

<p>By Chastelleux, whose book I am not able to
refer to now, the charge is repeated, and by half
a score of other honest, good natured people,
who have made books about the New World.</p>

<p>But, if you enquire into the business, you are
pretty sure to be told, inquire where you may,
that bundling is not known <i>there</i>, but somewhere
further back in the woods, or further <i>down east</i>.
Nay, while in every part of the United States
the multitude speak of bundling as the habit of
their neighbors, either east, west, north, or south,
where the witches of the country were <i>located</i>
about a century ago by the grandfathers of this
<a name="Page_114"></a>generation, I, myself, though I have taken
trouble enough to learn the truth, have never yet
been able to meet with a case of bundling&mdash;of
bundling proper, I should say&mdash;in the United
States, nor with but one trustworthy individual
who had ever met with so much as one case, and
he had met with <i>but</i> one, for which he would
give his word. These things are trifles; but
when they are told in books that are read and
trusted to throughout Europe; such books, too,
as that of the Marquis de Chastelleux, or that of
De Rouchefoucault, it becomes a matter of serious
inquiry. The truth must be told, whatever it is,
for the truth cannot be so bad, whatever it may
be, as the untruth which is now repeated of us.</p>

<p>The travels of Chastelleux are translated by
an Englishman who had been a long while in
this country. The book was undoubtedly written
with great care, by a very honest, able man,
who had very good opportunities of knowing the
truth; and is now set off by another very honest,
able man, who was, if anything, rather partial to
America&mdash;enough to make one wary of trusting
the report of any traveler who does not say in so
many words, after establishing a character for
himself&mdash;I saw this; I heard this; I take nobody's
word for what I now say, etc., etc. It
<a name="Page_115"></a>would be easy to enumerate a multitude of other
stories which are now believed in, about the people
of the United States, not only by the people
of Europe, and of Great Britain particularly, but
by the people of the United States themselves.
But a dry catalogue of such things would be of
little use.</p>

<p>[Here he refers to the charge reported of New
Englanders, that that they <i>eat pork and molasses&mdash;pork and
molasses</i> TOGETHER, which is here denied
as a ridiculous story. H.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;S.]</p>

<p>They bundle in Wales; bundling there is a
serious matter. A lady&mdash;a Welsh woman whose
word is truth itself&mdash;assured me not long ago,
that in her country they do not think a bit the
worse, of a girl for anticipating her duties, in
other words, for being a mother before she has
been a wife; they have discovered, perhaps, that
cause and effect may be convertible terms; that
in such a serious matter, none but a fool would
buy a pig in the poke, and that, after all, maternity
may lead to marriage there, as marriage leads
to maternity here. And why not? for after the
establishment of the lying-in hospitals of Russia,
the unmarried who bore <i>children to the state</i> were
proud of the duty, and were looked upon, we are
told, with great favor by the public. She added,
<a name="Page_116"></a>also, that she was once at a party made up of
sixteen or eighteen females, and females of good
characters, all but one or two of whom were
mothers, or had been so, before they were married.
By Chastelleux and his English translator
it would appear to have been very much the
same in America about the years 1780-1-2. It
is not so now. To have had a child before
marriage would now be fatal to a woman here,
whatever might be her condition or beauty; fatal
in every shape. No man would have courage to
marry her; no woman of character would associate
with her. Ask the first individual you
meet, above the age of twelve or thirteen here,
and you may have the name and history of every
poor girl in the neighborhood who has been so
unlucky as to have a child of her own without
leave, perhaps, within a period of six or eight
years in a populous neighborhood of twenty or
thirty miles about. A widow with half a score
of children, forty years ago, if we may believe
Dr. Franklin, was an object for the fortune
hunters of America. It is not so now. The
demand for widows, and for every sort of ready
made family is beginning to be over.</p>

<p>That which is called bundling here, though bad
enough, is not a twentieth part so bad. Here
<a name="Page_117"></a>it is only a mode of courtship. The parties instead
of sitting up together, go to bed together;
but go to bed with their clothes on. This would
appear to be a perilous fashion; but I have been
assured by the individual above, that he had
proof to the contrary; for in the particular case
alluded to, the only case I ever heard of on
good authority, although he was invited by the
parents of a pretty girl who stood near him, to
bundle with her, and although he <i>did</i> bundle
with her, he had every reason to believe, that if
he had been very free, or more free than he
might have been at a country frolick after they
had invited him to escort her, to sit up with her,
to dance with her, he would have been treated
as a traitor by all parties. He had a fair opportunity
of knowing the truth, and he spoke of
the matter as if he would prefer the etiquette of
sitting up to the etiquette of going to bed with a
girl who had been so brought up. He complained
of her as a prude. The following communication
appears, however, to be one that may
be depended on:<a name="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40">[40]</a></p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_118"></a>MR. NEAL&mdash;If you wish to know the truth
about bundling, I think your correspondent
V. could tell you all about it&mdash;it seems by his
confession that he has practiced it on a large
scale. I never heard of the thing till about three
years ago; an acquaintance of mine had gone to
spend the summer with an aunt, who lived somewhere
near Sandy river.<a name="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41">[41]</a> The following is a
copy of one of her letters while there:</p>

<p>&quot;'I should have written sooner, so don't think
me unkind, for I have been waiting for something
to write about. You requested me to give
you a faithful description of the country, the
manners and customs of the inhabitants, etc. I
have not been here quite three months, but I
have been everywhere, seen everything, and got
acquainted with everybody. I shall certainly inform
you of everything I have seen or heard that
is worth relating.</p>

<p>&quot;'You remember how you told me, before I
left home, that I was so well looking that if I
<a name="Page_119"></a>went so far back in the country I should be very
much admired and flattered, and have as many
lovers as I could wish for. I find it all true.
The people here are remarkably kind and attentive
to me; they seem to think that I must be
something more than common because I have
always lived so near Portland.</p>

<p>&quot;'But I must tell you that since I have been
here I have had a beau. You must know that
the young men, <i>in particular</i>, are very attentive
to me. Well, among these is <i>one</i> who is considered
the finest young man in the place, and
well he may be&mdash;he owns a good farm, which
has a large barn upon it, and a neat two story
house, all finished. These are the fruits of his
own industry; besides he is remarkably good
looking, is very large but well-proportioned, and
has a good share of what I call real manly beauty.
Soon after my arrival here I was introduced to
this man&mdash;no, not <i>introduced</i> neither, for they
never think of such a thing here. They all
know me of course, because I am a <i>stranger</i>.
Some days, three, four, or half a dozen, call to
see me, whom I never before saw or heard of;
they come and speak to me as if I were an old
acquaintance, and I converse with them as freely
as if I had always known them from childhood.
<a name="Page_120"></a>In this kind of a way I got acquainted with my
beau, that <i>was;</i> he was very attentive to me from
our first meeting. If we happened to be going
anywhere in company he was sure to offer me
his arm&mdash;no, I am wrong again, he never
offered me his arm in his life. If you go to
walk with a young man here, instead of offering
you his arm as the young men do up our way, he
either takes your hand in his, or passes one arm
around your waist; and this he does with such a
provoking, careless honesty, that you cannot for
your life be offended with him. Well, I had
walked with my Jonathan several times in this
kind of style. I confess there was something in
him I could not but like&mdash;he does not lack for
wit, and has a good share of common sense; his
language is never studied&mdash;he always seems to
speak from the heart. So when he asked what
sort of a companion he would make, I very candidly
answered, that I thought he would make
a very agreeable one. &quot;I think just so of you,&quot;
said he, &quot;and it shall not be my fault,&quot; he continued,
&quot;if we are not companions for life.&quot;
&quot;We shall surely make a bargain,&quot; said he, after
sitting silent a few moments, &quot;so we'll <i>bundle</i>
to-night.&quot; &quot;<i>Bundle</i> what?&quot; I asked. &quot;<i>We</i> will
bundle together,&quot; said he; &quot;you surely know
<a name="Page_121"></a>what I mean.&quot; I know that our farmers bundle
<i>wheat</i>, <i>cornstalks</i> and <i>hay;</i> do you mean that you
want me to help you bundle any of these?&quot;
inquired I. &quot;I mean that I want you to stay
with me to-night! It is the custom in this place,
when a man stays with a girl, if it is warm
weather, for them to throw themselves on the
bed, outside the bed clothes; if the weather is
cold, they crawl under the clothes, then if they
have anything to <i>say</i>, they say it&mdash;when they
get tired of talking they go to sleep; this is what
we call bundling&mdash;now what do you call it in
your part of the world?&quot; &quot;We have no such
works,&quot; answered I; &quot;not amongst respectable
people, nor do I think that any people would,
that either thought themselves respectable, or
wished to be thought so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Don't be too severe upon us, Miss &mdash;&mdash;, I
have always observed that those who <i>make believe</i>
so much modesty, have in reality but little.
I always act as I feel, and speak as I think. I
wish you to do the same, but have none of your
make-believes with me&mdash;you smile&mdash;you begin
to think you have been a little too scrupulous&mdash;you
have no objection to bundling <i>now</i>, have
you?&quot; &quot;Indeed I have.&quot; &quot;I am not to be
trifled with; so, if you refuse, I have done with
<a name="Page_122"></a>you forever.&quot; &quot;Then be done as quick as you
please, for I'll not bundle with you nor with any
other man.&quot; &quot;Then farewell, proud girl,&quot; said
he. &quot;Farewell, honest man,&quot; said I, and off he
went sure enough.</p>

<p>&quot;'I have since made inquiries about <i>bundling</i>,
and find that it is <i>really</i> the custom here, and
that they think no more harm of it, than we do
our way of a young couple sitting up together.
I have known an instance, since I have been
here, of a girl's taking her sweetheart to a neighbor's
house and asking for a bed or two to lodge
in, or rather to <i>bundle</i> in. They had company
at her father's, so that their beds were occupied;
she thought no harm of it. She and her family
are respectable.</p>

<p>&quot;'Grandmother says bundling was a very common
thing in our part of the country, in old
times; that most of the first settlers lived in log
houses, which seldom had more than one room
with a fire place; in this room the old people
slept, so if one of their girls had a sweetheart in
the winter she must either sit with him in the
room where her father and mother slept, or take
him into her sleeping room. She would choose
the latter for the sake of being alone with him;
but sometimes when the cold was very severe,
<a name="Page_123"></a>rather than freeze to death, they would crawl
under the bed-clothes; and this, after a while,
became a habit, a custom, or a fashion. The man
that I am going to send this by, is just ready to
start, so I cannot stop to write more now. In my
next I'll give you a more particular account of
the people here. Adieu.'</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Mr. Editor</i>, you may be sure that what is
related in the foregoing letter is the truth. I
know that there is considerable <i>other</i> information
in it, mixed up with <i>that</i> about which you wished
to be informed, but I could not very well separate
it.&quot;</p>

<p>So after all that has been said of the practice
of bundling in our country, by foreign writers,
travelers, and reviewers&mdash;after all the reproach
that has been heaped upon us, now that we are
able to get at the plain truth, it appears to be,
though certainly a bad practice, not half so bad
as the junketing and sitting up courtships that are
known elsewhere. Nay, more. Though in the
present state of society it is a practice that should
be utterly discountenanced everywhere, still it
would seem to have grown up out of the peculiar
circumstances of our first settlers; to be confined
<i>now</i> to remote and small districts (for I have
<a name="Page_124"></a>heard of only three instances, after all my inquiry);
and to be rapidly going out of practice.
Yet more; there can be no bad intentions, there
can be no evil consequences, where respectable
and modest women are not ashamed to acknowledge
that they bundle. I am anxious to know
the truth for the purpose of correcting both the
<i>misrepresentations</i> that are abroad, and the <i>practices</i>
that prevail here. Bundling, however, is
known in other countries, where they have less
excuse, and in Wales where they do <i>not</i> bundle,
as I have said before, it is no reproach for a
woman to have had a child before marriage. It
was so in Russia after Catharine established her
lying-in hospitals.</p>

<p>In the next number of <i>The Yankee</i> (August
20th) there is the following editorial paragraph:</p>
<br />

<p>BUNDLING.</p>

<p>There is a great outcry just now about the
paper on bundling which was in the last <i>Yankee</i>.
Now this very outcry proves the want of the
very paper alluded to. The article is about
bundling; and people who imagine bundling to
be what it is not, a highly improper and unchaste
<a name="Page_125"></a>familiarity, are offended with it; but the very
purpose of that paper is to show that bundling is
not what it is believed to be, that it is neither so
common nor so bad, not a fiftieth part so bad as
people have imagined.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><a name="Page_126"></a>
<a name="APPENDIX_II"></a><h2>APPENDIX II.</h2>
<a name="Page_127"></a><br />

<p>That the customs of courtship in many parts
of the United Kingdom at the present day, are
precisely what they were in some parts of New
England, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, fifty
years ago, is evident from the revelations of the
<i>Royal Commission on the Marriage Laws</i>, in the
year 1868. Dr. Strahan, a physician and surgeon,
who for nearly forty years has practiced in
the Scottish county of Stirling, testifies before the
commission, that his attention was first drawn to
the subject in consequence of observing the very
great extent of immorality among the working
classes, not only as evidenced by the large number
of illegitimate children, but also by the still
larger number of marriages after the woman was
with child; and the number of children born
within eight months of wedlock. He found, to
his astonishment, that among the working classes
<a name="Page_128"></a>(i.e., the agricultural laborers), nine out of ten
women, when married, either had had illegitimate
children, or were pregnant at the time of marriage.
&quot;I have,&quot; he says, &quot;a large midwifery
practice, and I very rarely attend a woman with
her first child, where the child is not born within
a few months of wedlock, or else she has had an
illegitimate child before.&quot; He believes it is very
common for women to allow themselves to be
seduced in the hope of being married. They go
on until they are <i>enceinte</i>, and then, if the young
man is at all a decent fellow, the friends interfere
and the marriage is hurried on. The sketch
which Dr. Strahan supplies of Scotch courtships,
explains all this part of his observation. Young
men and women meet together at night, and the
ordinary time is the middle of the night, when
every one else is in bed. &quot;It is universal,&quot; says
Dr. Strahan to the commission, &quot;among the
working classes, to have this manner of courtship
of which I speak; there is no other courtship,
in any other form; the fathers and mothers
will not allow their daughters to meet a young
man in the day-time; the young man never visits
the family, but the parents quite allow this; they
have done it themselves before, and there is no
objection to it. The young man comes, makes
<a name="Page_129"></a>a noise at the window; the young woman goes
out, they go to some outhouse; or perhaps the
young man is admitted to the young woman's
bedroom after all are in bed, and there is an hour
or two of what is called courtship, but which
would more properly be called flirtation, because
it is not necessary that there should be any engagement
to marry in these cases.&quot;</p>

<p>Lord Lyveden inquired: &quot;Do these meetings
take place at particular periods, such as harvest
time, or is it over the whole of the year?&quot;</p>

<p><i>Answer</i>: &quot;The whole of the year; very commonly
the young man visits the young woman
once a week.&quot;</p>

<p>Lord Chelmsford said: &quot;In England that
would be called <i>keeping company</i>. It is a very
extraordinary way of keeping company when the
parents allow their daughter to go out with the
young man at midnight, or the young man to
come into her bedroom.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Answer</i>: &quot;Yes; the parents know no other
way of doing it. I have reasoned with the parents
often when attending a case of illegitimate
birth, pointing out to the parents how it is they
have been led on, but they cannot imagine any
other way of doing it; their daughters must have
husbands, and there is no other way of courting.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_130"></a>Mr. Justice O'Hagan asking&mdash;&quot;Does it prevail
generally in Scotland?&quot; was answered&mdash;&quot;Universally
among the agricultural laborers.&quot;</p>

<p>In reply to an inquiry by Mr. Dunlop, whether
these young men lived under any kind of supervision
and knowledge of their masters, or whether
they could go out and in as they pleased, Dr.
Strahan stated that &quot;plowmen, for instance, very
often live in <i>bothies</i>, or in the farm house; they
get out after all are in bed, out of the window;
or, if they live in a bothie, without any trouble.
They go to the neighboring farm-house, they
knock at the window, the girl comes to the
window, and, if she know the young man&mdash;or,
after a little parley, if she does not know him&mdash;she
either comes out and goes with him to an outhouse,
or he comes into her bedroom. You
must remember that they have no other means of
intercourse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is the point you press so much?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; a young woman cannot see either a
sweetheart or an acquaintance in any other way.
I believe if it was not for fear of being out at
night, the girls would visit one another in the
same way; they have no other means of visiting;
the customs of the country are such that a
<a name="Page_131"></a>young man could not be seen going in day-light
to visit his sweetheart.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Justice O'Hagan: &quot;If the father knew
that the young man was coming into the house,
and knew that he was with his daughter, would
he not interfere?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He would lie comfortably in his bed, knowing
that his daughter was in an out-house or barn
with a young man, for perhaps two hours; shutting
his eyes to it in the same way that a person
in the higher ranks would shut his eyes to his
daughter going out for a walk with a young man.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Strahan said also: &quot;When you come to
the middle class a young man would not marry a
girl that had had a child to another man; and
very probably he would not marry a girl that had
had a child to himself; but in the lower classes
it is not so; it is almost universal to marry a
woman that has had a child, or that is with child
to himself; but it is very frequent to marry a
woman that has had a child to another man; the
only objection is the burden of the child; the
burden of the child might be an obstacle, but the
disgrace would be none.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it supposed,&quot; asked a commissioner, &quot;that
the woman, by marrying this other man, wipes
off her disgrace with the former?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_132"></a>Yes; but it is so common that the disgrace
is not so much as to prevent the young man marrying
her.&quot;</p>

<p>The attorney-general: &quot;It is hardly within our
inquiry, but still it is interesting to know; can
you tell me whether, in these cases, where the
woman marries a man who is not the father
of her child, any confusion, as to the parent of
the previously born child, arises? Are they apt
in law, to pass as the children of the subsequent
husband?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I do not think so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The distinction is always kept up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The distinction is always kept up; very
often the illegitimate child goes by his own
father's name, even among the other children;
and I do not think there is apt to be any confusion
of that kind.&quot;</p>

<p>Still, it seems that, in severely Calvinistic
Scotia, the church does not wholly wink at this
state of things. The sinning couple, after marriage,
have to go through a certain whitewashing
at church before they are admitted to what are
called church privileges. They have to go before
a kirk session, consisting of the minister and
perhaps half a dozen elders, when they are <i>admonished</i>.
If the parties are married, they ap<a name="Page_133"></a>pear
but once; if not married, generally three
times. They tender themselves for rebuke without
invitation, as without it the child cannot be
baptized, or admission given to the sacrament.
They apply to the minister in private, and confess
their fault, and he causes them to be summoned
before the church session.</p>

<div class="note"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2">[2]</a> <i>A History of the Highlands, and of the Highland
Clans</i>, etc. (Jas. Browne, LL.D., Advocate, 4 vols. London,
1853), IV, 398.
</p><p>
&quot;The law of marriage observed in the Highlands has
frequently been as little understood as that of succession,
and similar misconceptions have prevailed regarding
it. This was, perhaps, to be expected. In a country
where a bastard son was often found in undisturbed
possession of the chiefship or property of a clan, and
where such bastard generally received the support of the
clansmen against the claims of the feudal heir, it was
natural to suppose that very loose notions of succession
were entertained by the people; that legitimacy conferred
no exclusive rights; and that the title founded on
birth alone might be set aside in favor of one having
no other claim than that of election. But this, although
a plausible, would nevertheless be an erroneous supposition.
The person here considered as a bastard, and
described as such, was by no means viewed in the
same light by the Highlanders, because, according to
their law of marriage, which was originally very different
from the feudal system in this matter, his claim to
legitimacy was as undoubted as that of the feudal heir
afterward became. It is well known that the notions of
the Highlanders were peculiarly strict in regard to matters
of hereditary succession, and that no people on
earth was less likely to sanction any flagrant deviation
from what they believed to be the right and true line of
descent. All their peculiar habits, feelings and prejudices
were in direct opposition to a practice which, had
it been really acted upon, must have introduced endless
disorder and confusion, and hence the natural explanation
of this apparent anomaly seems to be, what Mr.
Skene has stated, namely, that a person who was feudally
a bastard might in their view be considered as legitimate,
and therefore entitled to be supported in accordance
with their strict ideas of hereditary right, and
their habitual tenacity of whatever belonged to their
ancient usages. Nor is this mere conjecture or hypothesis.
A singular custom regarding marriage, retained till
a late period amongst the Highlanders, and clearly indicating
that their law of marriage originally differed in
some essential points from that established under the
feudal system, seems to afford a simple and natural
explanation of the difficulty by which genealogists have
been so much puzzled.
</p><p>
&quot;This custom was termed <i>hand-fasting</i>, and consisted
in a species of contract between two chiefs, by which
it was agreed that the heir of one should live with the
daughter of the other as her husband for twelve months
and a day. If, in that time, the lady became a mother,
or proved to be with child the marriage became good in
law, even although no priest had performed the marriage
ceremony in due form; but should there not have occurred
any appearance of issue, the contract was considered
at an end, and each party was at liberty to
marry or hand-fast with any other. It is manifest that
the practice of so peculiar a species of marriage must
have been in terms of original law among the Highlanders,
otherwise it would be difficult to conceive how such
a custom could have originated, and it is in fact one
which seems naturally to have arisen from the form of
their society, which rendered it a matter of such vital
importance to secure the lineal succession of their
chiefs. It is perhaps not improbable that it was this
peculiar custom which gave rise to the report handed
down by the Roman and other historians, that the
ancient inhabitants of Great Britain had their wives in
common, or that it was the foundation of that law of
Scotland by which natural children became legitimatized
by subsequent marriage.<a name="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3">[3]</a> And as this custom remained
in the Highlands until a very late period, the sanction
of ancient custom was sufficient to induce them to persist
in regarding the offspring of such marriages as
legitimate.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4">[4]</a>
</p><p>
It appears, indeed, that as late as the sixteenth century,
the issue of a hand-fast marriage claimed the earldom
of Sutherland. The claimant, according to Sir
Robert Gordon, described himself as one lawfully descended
from his father, John, the third earl, because,
as he alleged, &quot;his mother was <i>hand-fasted</i> and fianced
to his father;&quot; and his claim was bought off (which
shows that it was not considered as altogether incapable
of being maintained) by Sir Adam Gordon, who had
married the heiress of Earl John. Such, then, was the
nature of the peculiar and temporary connection which
gave rise to the apparent anomalies which we have been
considering. It was a custom which had for its object,
not to interrupt but to preserve the lineal succession of
the chiefs, and to obviate the very evil of which it is
conceived to afford a glaring example. But after the introduction
of the feudal law, which, in this respect, was
directly opposed to the ancient Highland law, the lineal
and legitimate heir, according to Highland principles,
came to be regarded as a bastard by the government,
which accordingly considered him as thereby incapacitated
for succeeding to the honors and property of his race;
and hence originated many of those disputes concerning
succession and chiefship, which embroiled families with
one another, as well as with the government, and were
productive of incredible disorder, mischief and bloodshed.
No allowance was made for the ancient usages
of the people, which were probably but ill understood;
and the rights of rival claimants were decided according
to the principles of a foreign system of law, which was
long resisted, and never admitted except from necessity.
It is to be observed, however, that the Highlanders
themselves drew a broad distinction between bastard
sons and the issue of the hand-fast unions above described.
The former were rigorously excluded from
every sort of succession, but the latter were considered
as legitimate as the offspring of the most regularly
solemnized marriage.
</p><p>
This practice obtained not only among chiefs, but
common people.
</p><p>
Walter Scott, in the XXV chapter of the <i>Monastery</i>, in
a note, says: &quot;This custom of hand-fasting actually
prevailed in the upland days. It arose partly from the
want of priests. While the convents subsisted, monks
were detached on regular circuits through the wilder
districts, to marry those who had lived in this species
of connexion. A practice of the same kind existed in
the Isle of Portland.&quot;</p></div>

<div class="note"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3">[3]</a> This is a mistake in point of law. The principle of
legitimation by subsequent marriage, was first explicitly
announced in an imperial constitution of Constantine,
and being wisely recognized by the church, it was
adopted by the canonists, through whom it passed into
our law. The attempt to introduce it into England
failed, in consequence of the attachment of the people
to their ancient Saxon constitutions; and hence, although
it was recognized in the statutes of Merton, it was subsequently
discarded, and never afterwards found admission into the municipal
system of the neighboring kingdom.
There can be no doubt whatever that the principle
is one which reason, morality and religion must
equally approve.</p></div>

bond and those which relate to chastity generally,
recognize a degree of laxity respecting female honor,
and, yet more remarkably, an absence of feminine delicacy,
such as could scarcely be paralleled amongst the
most uncivilized people now. They are of such a nature,
that though most characteristic, they must be
passed by with this general mention. The distinction
between the Celtic and Teutonic races is perhaps in no
case more plainly marked than in this: The Anglo-Saxon
laws on this subject (always excepting those of
the <i>ecclesiastical</i> authorities) are modesty itself, notwithstanding
their plain speaking, compared with those
of the Welsh legislators.&quot;</p></div>

</p><p>
&quot;You must know further, that Two Hours after Sunset
the Old Supperannuated Persons, or Slaves (who
never lie in their Masters' Huts) take care to cover up
the Fire before they go. 'Tis then that the Young
Savage comes well wrapt up to his Mistress's Hut, and
lights a sort of a Match at the Fire; after which he
opens the Door of his Mistress's Apartment and makes
up to her bed: If she blows out the light, he lies down
by her; but if she pulls her Covering over her Face,
he retires; that being a Sign that she will not receive

<div class="note"><p><a name="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20">[20]</a> Verily, Peters's sarcasm savors as much of truth as
humor when, speaking of bundling, he says: &quot;The Indians
who had this method of courtship among them in
1634, are the most chaste set of people in the world.
Concubinage and fornication are vices none of them are
addicted to, except such as forsake the laws of Hobbamockon
and turn Christians. The savages have taken
many female prisoners, carried them back three hundred
miles into their country, and kept them several years,
and yet not a single instance of their violating the
laws of chastity has ever been known. This cannot be
said of the French, or of the English, whenever Indian
or other women have fallen into their hands.&quot;</p></div>

<div class="note"><p><a name="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21">[21]</a> &quot;Great jealousy did they likewise stir up by their
intermeddling and successes among the divine sex; for
being a race of brisk, likely, pleasant tongued varlets,
they soon seduced the light affections of the simple
lasses from their ponderous Dutch gallants. Among
other hideous customs, they attempted to introduce
among them that of <i>bundling</i>, which the Dutch lasses
of the Nederlandts, with that eager passion for novelty
and foreign fashions natural to their sex, seemed very
well inclined to follow, but that their mothers, being
more experienced in the world, and better acquainted
with men and things, strenuously discountenanced all

<div class="note"><p><a name="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32">[32]</a> The Rev. Alonzo B. Chapin, in his <i>History of
Ancient Glastenbury, Conn.</i> (p. 80), says that the church
records, during the pastorate of the Rev. John Eels
[1759-1791], &quot;compel us to believe that the influence of
the French war had been as unfavorable to morals as
destructive to life; and that the absurd practice of
<i>bundling</i> prevalent in those days, was not infrequently
attended with the consequences that might have been
expected, and that both together, aided by a previous
growing laxity of morals, and accelerated by many concurrent
causes, had rolled a tide of immorality over
the land, which not even the bulwark of the church had
been able to withstand. The church records of the first
society, from 1760 to 1790, raise presumptions of the
strongest kind, that then, as since, <i>incontinence</i> and
<i>intemperance</i> were among the sins of the people. What
the condition of things in Eastbury [an ecclesiastical
society in the east part of Glastenbury] was, we have
no means of knowing, <i>as that portion of the church
records which treats of this point, was long ago</i> carefully
<i>removed</i>. [N.B. Italics are our own.] There is
no reason, however, to suppose that this state of thing's
was peculiar to Glastenbury, for there is too much evidence
that it prevailed throughout the country.&quot;
</p><p>
Mr. Chapin's deductions from the revelations of the
Glastenbury records, will be fully justified by the experience
and observation of every antiquarian who has had
occasion to <i>dig deep</i> among the civil and ecclesiastical
records of almost any one of the older towns of New
England. We have before us, while writing, a copy,
made some years since, by ourselves, of the records of
the first church of Woodstock, Conn., covering the
period from 1727 to 1777, in which are a large number
of entries, mostly the names of parties who made <i>confessions</i>
of this sort before that church. These cases
occur most frequently between the years 1737 and 1770.
Our own observation among the records of the old
churches in Windsor and East Windsor, is, in effect,
the same, and we have occasionally happened upon the
original manuscript confessions of individuals read to
the church before they were formally admitted to its
communion.</p></div>

<div class="note"><p><a name="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33">[33]</a> <i>History of Dedham, Mass</i>, (by Erastus Worthington,
1827), page 108. Under ministry of Rev. Jason
Haven, ordained February 6, 1756.
</p><p>
&quot;Revolutionary times having produced a disposition
to investigate all the former principles and opinions of
men, in politics and church government, Mr. Haven
caused the mode of admission into the church to be
altered. This was done in 1793. The new method
required the candidate to be propounded to the congregation
by the minister. If no objections within fourteen
days were made, he was then of course admitted.
At the same time the church covenant and creed was
altered, and made very general in its expressions. This
creed had so few articles, that all persons professing and
calling themselves Christians, would assent to it without
any objections. The church had ever in this place
required of its members guilty of unlawful cohabitation
before marriage, a public confession of that crime before
the whole congregation. The offending female
stood in the broad aisle beside the partner of her
guilt. If they had been married, the declaration of the
man was silently assented to by the woman. This had
always been a delicate and difficult subject for church
discipline. The public confession, if it operated as a
corrective, likewise produced merriment with the profane.
I have seen no instance of a public confession
for this fault, until the ministry of Mr. Dexter [1724-1755],
and then they were extremely rare. In 1781 the
church gave the confessing parties the privilege of
making a private confession to the church, in the room
of a public confession. In Mr. Havens ministry, the
number of cases of unlawful cohabitation increased to
an alarming degree. For twenty-five years before 1781,
twenty-five cases had been publicly acknowledged before
the congregation, and fourteen cases within the last
ten years. This brought out the minister to preach on
the subject from the pulpit. Mr. Haven, in a long
and memorable discourse, sought out the cause of the
growing sin, and suggested the proper remedy. He
attributed the frequent recurrence of the fault to the
custom then prevalent, of females admitting young men
to their beds, who sought their company with intentions
of marriage. And he exhorted all to abandon that
custom, and no longer expose themselves to temptations
which so many were found unable to resist.
</p><p>
&quot;The immediate effect of this discourse on the congregation
has been described to me, and was such as
we must naturally suppose it would be. A grave man,
the beloved and revered pastor of the congregation,
comes out suddenly on his audience, and discusses a
subject on which mirth and merriment only had been
heard, and denounces a favorite custom. The females
blushed and hung down their heads. The men, too,
hung down their heads, and now and then looked out
from under their fallen eyebrows, to observe how others
supported the attack. If the outward appearance of the
assembly was somewhat composed, there was a violent
internal agitation in many minds. And now, when
forty-five years have expired, the persons who were
present at the delivery of that sermon, express its
effects by saying: 'How queerly I felt!' 'What a
time it was!' 'This was close preaching indeed!' The
custom was abandoned. The sexes learned to cultivate
the proper degree of delicacy in their intercourse, and
instances of unlawful cohabitation in this town since
that time have been extremely rare.&quot;</p></div>

subject of compelling persons to confess themselves
guilty of an offense, of which they said, &quot;if not absolutely,

acted upon, and some relaxation made in the rule before
adopted; but a part of the record is so worn as to be
illegible.

Page 177. June 1, 1761. &quot;The church also at this
meeting, voted in relation to the confession necessary
to be made by parents, to entitle their children to the
rite of baptism, who might be supposed to have committed
the offence of which, in Mr. Trowbridge's time,
they supposed that, 'if not absolutely, yet next to impossible
to convict them,' not materially varying from a
<i>seven-months</i> rule heretofore adopted. These regulations
were signed by the moderator, and assented to by
the pastor elect.&quot;
</p><p>
Page 181. &quot;During Mr. Dana's ministry [1761-1775]
124 persons (38 males, 86 females) were admitted to
the church in full communion; 200 (77 males, 123 females)
owned the baptismal covenant. Of the first
class, 14 confessed having committed the offence aforementioned,
and of the last class, 66, a proportion not
indicative of good customs and morals.&quot;</p></div>

a light and retires, saying, you know the way up
stairs, turn to the right, etc. At a proper time he follows,
finding her nicely snuggled under the bed clothes,
having previously put on a very appropriate and secure
night dress, made neither like a bloomer or mantilla,
but something like a common dress, excepting the lower
part, which is furnished with legs, like drawers, properly
attached. The dress is drawn at the neck and
waist with strings tied with a very strong knot, and
over this is put the ordinary apparel.&quot;</p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
